1. Change the runtime to GPU
2. To train the model (takes about 5 minutes) and print the validation
accuracy:
a. Run all blocks
3. To directly test the trained model and print the testing accuracy:
a. Upload the ‘trained_results’ file that is zipped along with the
code to the drive such that the path of the file looks like this:
/content/drive/MyDrive/COEN240/trained_results
b. Comment the line numbers (82-84)
c. Run the last block again
